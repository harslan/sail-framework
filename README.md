# SAIL Framework

**Developing Judgment for an AI-Augmented World**

---

## The Problem

Students can use AI. They can prompt it, iterate with it, and integrate it into their workflows. But they struggle to *evaluate* it — to know when AI output is reliable and when it's confidently wrong.

Each time a student accepts AI output without evaluation, they accumulate what MIT researchers call **cognitive debt**. The debt compounds. Eventually, when AI makes a mistake — and it will — they lack the capacity to catch it.

## The Framework

SAIL develops four interconnected competencies:

| | Competency | What It Means |
|---|---|---|
| **S** | Social Intelligence | Communicating about AI to colleagues, clients, and stakeholders |
| **A** | AI Literacy | Understanding AI's capabilities, limitations, and failure modes |
| **I** | Innovation/Inquiry | Questioning AI outputs; treating AI as thought partner, not oracle |
| **L** | Leadership | Taking responsibility for Human-AI collaboration outcomes |

## The Insight

**Critical thinking isn't a fifth pillar. It's what makes the other four function.**

The Greek word *kritikos* — the root of "critical" — means "able to discern." Critical thinking was never meant to be purely analytical. From its origins, it included the perceptual capacity to see what matters.

The APA Delphi Report (Facione, 1990) defines critical thinking as "purposeful, self-regulatory **judgment**." Not just analysis. Judgment.

When we say SAIL develops judgment, we're recovering the full meaning of critical thinking and applying it to AI education.

## The Promise

**Skills can be automated. Judgment cannot.**

As AI capabilities grow, the human capacity that remains irreplaceable is judgment — the integration of perception and analysis that tells you what to do when the answer isn't obvious.

**Not just AI-literate graduates. Graduates with judgment.**
